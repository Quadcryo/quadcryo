    title={Proofs and Applications of Quadratic Reciprocity},
    author={Carl Relyea, Matias},
    abstract={As one of the most important theorems in Elementary Number Theory, the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity is both incredibly beautiful and rewarding to explore. In this paper, we will explore characteristics of quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues, and apply them to varying conditions on primes. After that, we will illustrate and prove a statement of equivalence of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using an assertion by Euler. Following this, we offer three unique proofs of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Eisenstein's Lemma and lattice-point counting, primitive nth roots of unity, and Quadratic Gauss Sums. Finally, we give a brief introduction to a generalization of the Legendre Symbol known as the Jacobi Symbol, and then prove Fermat's Theorem on the Sum of two Squares using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity and the Method of Infinite Descent.},

    title={On the Value of the Quadratic Gauss Sum},
    abstract={In this rather brief paper, we will define and prove several interesting properties of the Quadratic Gauss Sum, and eventually end with the main theorem of this paper: the sign of the Quadratic Gauss Sum. The proof that we will provide is one by Kronecker, although there are many more that can be interesting. This is not a generalization to Gauss Sums, but we will utilize the conventional notation with the Dirichlet Character $$\chi$$ for the sake of functionality. },

    title={An Introduction to Algebraic Numbers and Algebraic Integers},
    author={Carl Relyea, Matias},
    abstract={In this brief introduction to algebraic numbers and algebraic integers, we will explore some properties of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and through the language of algebraic numbers and algebraic integers, state and prove several fundamental results in field theory and ring theory; namely that the set of algebraic numbers forms a field and that the set of algebraic integers forms a ring. These structures are related to and stem from their respective algebraic number fields, known as $$\mathbb{Q}$$ modules and $$\mathbb{Z}$$ modules respectively.},

  title={A Brief Introduction to Bézier Curves},
  abstract={In this paper we will define the Bézier curve and introduce several interesting properties. We will also introduce the Bernstein polynomial and Bernstein basis polynomials, and state how they relate to De Casteljau's algorithm and rational Bézier curves. We will conclude with a short derivation of the derivative of the Bézier curve, alongside an outline for a method of calculating the derivative of a Bézier curve at a given point.},
