    title={Proofs and Applications of Quadratic Reciprocity},
    author={C. Relyea, Matias},
    abstract={As one of the most important theorems in Elementary Number Theory, the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity is both incredibly beautiful and rewarding to explore. In this paper, we will explore characteristics of quadratic residues and quadratic nonresidues, and apply them to varying conditions on primes. After that, we will illustrate and prove a statement of equivalence of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using an assertion by Euler. Following this, we offer three unique proofs of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity using Eisenstein's Lemma and lattice-point counting, primitive nth roots of unity, and Quadratic Gauss Sums. Finally, we give a brief introduction to a generalization of the Legendre Symbol known as the Jacobi Symbol, and then prove Fermat's Theorem on the Sum of two Squares using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity and the Method of Infinite Descent.},

  title={A Brief Introduction to Bézier Curves},
  abstract={In this paper we will define the Bézier curve and introduce several interesting properties. We will also introduce the Bernstein polynomial and Bernstein basis polynomials, and state how they relate to De Casteljau's algorithm and rational Bézier curves. We will conclude with a short derivation of the derivative of the Bézier curve, alongside an outline for a method of calculating the derivative of a Bézier curve at a given point.},

  abstract={In this expository paper, we will outline several interesting properties of the q-factorial and its relationship with inversions, the q-derivative and the q-analogue of Taylor’s theorem, a theorem about the uniqueness of q-antiderivatives up to a constant alongside evaluation of definite q-integrals, as well as several perspectives and proofs of the q-binomial theorem. We will conclude with an introduction to the q-Pochhammer symbol, and use it to define the q-hypergeometric function and prove an interesting fact about the special q-hypergeometric series 1Φ0.},

  title={On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity},
  abstract={Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as ``the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. However, this paper aims to approach reciprocity with ample detail to motivate its existence. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group F*. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted Z[ω], and further investigations into the residue class ring Z[ω]/πZ[ω] for π prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We will then use multiplicative characters to define the cubic residue character and state cubic reciprocity in its entirety. Following this, we provide a proof of the cubic reciprocity law as well as its supplementary theorems using cubic Gauss sums. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime 2 and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for 2 to be a cubic residue. We conclude with the statement of biquadratic reciprocity and provide a brief discussion on how it relates to cubic reciprocity in both its proof and usage of the analogy between the Eisenstein integers, Z[ω], and the Gaussian integers, Z[i].},

  title={The Quadratic and Cubic Characters of 2},
  abstract={The solvability of the cubic congruence x^{3}≡2 (mod p) is referred to as the cubic character of 2. In evaluating the cubic character of 2, we introduce the Eisenstein integers, Gauss and Jacobi sums, and the law of cubic reciprocity. We motivate this proof by giving ample historical information surrounding the early development of higher reciprocity laws as well as Gauss' proof of the solvability of the quadratic congruence x^{2}≡2 (mod p); conventionally the quadratic character of 2. We simultaneously outline other relevant contributions by Fermat, Euler, Legendre, Jacobi, and Eisenstein.},

  title={``Can You Even?" An Exploration of Polyominos},
  abstract={This paper was inspired by AMS Mathematics Magazine problem #2175 in [1] which asks ``For which integers n ≥ 3 can an n × n square grid be colored black and white—using each color at least once—so that every possible placement of a W-pentomino covers an even number of black squares?” We extend this problem to consider other and more general polyominos in square grids, as well as grids composed of triangles, and present their respective results. We also prove a solution to the original problem that is 2 ≤ n ≤ 5.},
