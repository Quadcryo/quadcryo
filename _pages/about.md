My name is Matias, and I am a first year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying (pure) mathematics.
<br>
<br>
This website serves the dual purpose of presenting both expository and original work pertaining to areas that I am interested in (papers and publictions, under "Articles"), as well as acting as a semi-serious pseudo-blog ("Memoirs") that documents some of my mathematical experiences, opinions, and sometimes existential pieces that make no sense. Currently I am interested in number theory and algebra—specifically reciprocity laws—but new mathematical territory will cause my interests to expand and change. Thank you for visiting this site.

Oh, and a little <a href="https://texnique.xyz">TeXnique</a> can't hurt right?
