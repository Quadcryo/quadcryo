My name is Matias, and I will be a first year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill beginning in 2025. 
<br>
<br>
My main academic interest is in mathematics. This site is a place where I can informally publish ideas and display any research projects or experiences that I have had so far. My main research interests are in number theory and algebra, but I have extended myself in several different directions over my time as a new researcher, and am constantly searching for new material to learn. My activity here is entirely dependent on my dedication to producing new work, but the act of manually writing $$\LaTeX$$ is also something that brings me great enjoyment and gives me dopamine so that is something else to consider. I also enjoy writing very much, so there is the possibility that I produce a piece of existentialism that makes absolutely no sense.
