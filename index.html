<p>My name is Matias, and I am a 16 year old student. My main academic interest is in mathematics. This site is a place where I can informally publish ideas and display any research projects or experiences that I have had so far. My main research interests are in number theory and algebra, but I have extended myself in several different directions over my time as a new researcher, and am constantly searching for new material to learn. My activity here is entirely dependent on my dedication to producing new work, but manually writing \(\LaTeX\) is also something that brings me great enjoyment and gives me dopamine so that is something else to consider.</p>
