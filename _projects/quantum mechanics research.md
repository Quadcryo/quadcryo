<i> Description </i>
<br>
This has been an ongoing project for many months now. I have worked on it actively and inactively over this time, and have made significant progress in linear algebra and working in Hilbert Space. While I know that many topics here will require significantly more reading and problem-solving, it is healthy to create goals along the way, so that is just what I have done. My research goal right now is to understand the spectral theorem and spectral decomposition.

NOTES
<br>
In order to begin to understand quantum mechanics, one must begin with the absolute basics of linear algebra. A finite-dimensional vector space with dim$$n$$ is a vector space $$V$$ for which there exists some finite set of vectors $$U=\{u_{1},u_{2},\ldots,u_{n}\}$$ that spans the vector space, or $$\text{span}U=V$$. An important notation to understand in quantum mechanics is the braket notation. With this notation, we denote a vector as a so-called "ket", represented as $$|v_{i}\rangle\in V$$, where $$V$$ is a vector space. The "bra" portion of the braket notation is represented as $$\langle v_{i}|$$, and we will explain its significance later.

In quantum mechanics, we commonly refer to matrices as "linear operators". A linear operator is a function $$f: V \rightarrow W$$ from a vector space $$V$$ to a vector space $$W$$ that is linear in its inputs, namely
