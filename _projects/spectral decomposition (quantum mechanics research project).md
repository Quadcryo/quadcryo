In the previous set of notes, we briefly introduced the notion of normality. In quantum mechanics, determining the eigendecomposition of a matrix and determining the diagonal matrix are extremely important, as they allow us to represent certain operators in terms of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The act of writing a diagonisable matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors with respect to an orthonormal basis is known as spectral decomposition. The spectral theorem, which we will introduce and prove here, proves several more facts about certain types of operators, and guarantees the existence of the spectral decomposition.

<b> Theorem </b> (Spectral Theorem)
<br>
<br>
Let $$A$$ be a symmetric linear operator with real entries. Then
<br>

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
    \text{(i)} & A \ \text{has real eigenvalues}, \\ 
    \text{(ii)} &  \text{there is a basis of} \ \mathbb{R}^{n} \ \text{such that it has the eigenvectors of} \ A. 
\end{array}
$$
