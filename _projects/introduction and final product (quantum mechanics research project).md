<i> Description </i>
<p>
This has been an ongoing project for many months now. I have worked on it actively and inactively over this time, and have made significant progress in linear algebra and working in Hilbert Space. While I know that many topics here will require significantly more reading and problem-solving, it is healthy to create goals along the way, so that is just what I have done. My research goal right now is to understand the spectral theorem and spectral decomposition. The final piece(s), whatever it may be, will be displayed here when it is complete.

(NOTE: When we refer to a "number" in these notes, we are more often than not referring to some complex number from $$\mathbb{C}$$. When we speak of a finite-dimensional vector space, we are largely talking about a finite-dimensional vector space over the field $$\mathbb{C}$$)
