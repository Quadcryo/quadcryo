<i>Abstract </i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we use data obtained from a survey of high school students to determine the link between students having fun on math homework and their confidence in solving math problems.

<p> The paper can be found <a href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/projectpdf/matias-relyea-kyle-hollars-math-fun-confidence-stats.pdf">here</a>.</p>
