    title={On the Value of the Quadratic Gauss Sum},
    abstract={In this rather brief paper, we will define and prove several interesting properties of the Quadratic Gauss Sum, and eventually end with the main theorem of this paper: the sign of the Quadratic Gauss Sum. The proof that we will provide is one by Kronecker, although there are many more that can be interesting. This is not a generalization to Gauss Sums, but we will utilize the conventional notation with the Dirichlet Character Ï‡ for the sake of functionality.},

    title={An Introduction to Algebraic Numbers and Algebraic Integers},
    author={C. Relyea, Matias},
    abstract={In this brief introduction to algebraic numbers and algebraic integers, we will explore some properties of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and through the language of algebraic numbers and algebraic integers, state and prove several fundamental results in field theory and ring theory; namely that the set of algebraic numbers forms a field and that the set of algebraic integers forms a ring. These structures are related to and stem from their respective algebraic number fields, known as Q modules and Z modules respectively.},
