While looking around for new mathematics to learn, I encountered the notion of the $$q$$-analogue. The $$q$$-analogue of some statement or concept is a parameterization of that statement in terms of some new parameter $$q$$, which, when equal to $$1$$, yields the original statement. If when $$q=1$$ the statement is undefined or the statement involves some discontinuities, then we can determine the $$q$$-analogue when $$q$$ approaches $$1$$ from either the left or right. Since this is a very new concept to me, I'm just going to cover the absolute basics with the introduction of notions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(discrete_mathematics)">inversions</a> in terms of the so-called "$$q$$-factorial", the $$q$$-analogue of the derivative (as a brief introduction to $$q$$-calculus), and the $$q$$-analogue of the binomial theorem. We may also introduce the concept of a hypergeometric series, and will be using the Pochhammer notation for factorials.
