The submission process is everything but familiar to me. While I did submit to the arXiv, the arXiv is not a peer-reviewed journal, unlike many other mathematical journals. Over the past two months I have been working carefully on a paper that relates closely to the topic in <i> On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity </i>, and I was debating whether to submit it to the American Mathematical Monthly (AMM) - a prestigious journal for expository articles that is well-respected in the math community - or another journal such as the Mathematics Magazine (MM). After much thought and revision (as well as some much-needed guidance), I decided that my article was not novel enough to warrant a place in AMM, but that it would perhaps be suitable for MM. So, today (or rather yesterday), I submitted my article to MM. 
<br>
<br>
Here are some thoughts that I have. First, I do not have incredibly high expectations for the publication of this article. While I know that MM is perhaps on the lower end of journals in general (despite featuring incredibly expository work), it still has a lower standard based in originality and novelty. While I think my paper certainly is interesting and would be appropriate to the readership of MM, I am not entirely sure. I guess we'll see. Second, publication takes a long time. The website for MM indicates that, on average, the first decision regarding an article will be 19 days. Now, this is kind of arbitrary - it can take far longer or far less time. Looking back at previously published articles, it seems that people took anywhere from a few weeks to an entire year to publish. That's a long time. I guess we'll see how long this takes!
<br>
<br>
If the paper is rejected from MM, I can still possibly publish in a different undergraduate journal - we'll see. Either way, I'm going to post this paper on the arXiv at some point. I will update this page if anything happens.

The paper is now informally available on this website. I am still awaiting notice from MM. A pdf is available <a href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/assets/pdf/matias-quadcub3.pdf">here</a>, and the arXiv preprint is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21646">here</a>.

This journey has reached an important milestone. It seems that my paper has been "reviewed favorably" by Mathematics Magazine, and after completing minor revisions, it will go on to publication. In this post, I'll cover a little bit of the timeline of the journey this paper has taken and some of my thoughts.

The above shows a sort of timeline of events in the submission process (I'll update it later when more stuff happens, but for now, I have until 18 April, 2025 to revise and resubmit for eventual publication). 
<br>
<br>
Here are some initial thoughts. The publication process seems like something really exciting, but in reality, it's mostly waiting. Just waiting. And a lot of it. This should be pretty clear from the timeline shown as evidenced by the 4 month gap between submission and decision, but it really isn't put into perspective until you're in it. I found myself refreshing that page for a while until I eventually gave up - each step in the process felt like an eternal wait, so reaching a point with some more certainty is a great feeling. If I have any more thoughts or any interesting comments about referee comments on my paper, maybe I'll write more here. For now, it's just some revisions.
