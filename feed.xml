So, today, we will develop the notion of it in a series of notes with comprehensive descriptions. 
<br />
<br />
To begin, let’s define what a multiplicative function, otherwise known as number-theoretic function, is. A number-theoretic function is a function that satisfies the property \(f(mn) = f(m)f(n)\) for \(\text{gcd}(m,n)=1\), or \(m,n\) coprime. If this property holds for all such \(m\) and \(n\), then the function is completely multiplicative. We now introduce the Möbius function \(\mu(n)\). 
<br /></p>

\[\begin{equation*}
\mu(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
1 &amp; \text{if} \ n=1 \\
0 &amp; \text{if} \ p^{2}|n, \ p \ \text{prime} \\ 
(-1)^{l} &amp; \text{if} \ n=p_{1}p_{2}\cdots p_{l}, \text{where} \ p_{i}\text{s are distinct}. 
\end{array}\right}
\end{equation*}\]

<p><br />
The second property that \(\mu(n)=0\) if \(p^{2}|n\) can be restated as \(\mu(n)=0\) is \(n\) is not prime square-free, or it is divisible by the square of some prime. When we talk about number-theoretic functions, we will be using a funky looking sum. This sum is written as
<br /></p>

\[\sum_{d|n}f(d).\]

<p><br />
Essentially, it takes the sum of the function \(f(d)\) for \(d\) that divides some pre-defined number \(n\). For example, If \(f(d)=d\) and \(n\) is prime, then the only divisors of a prime number are \(1\) and itself, so that \(\sum_{d|n}f(d) = n + 1\). We now proceed to prove some important properties of multiplicative functions that will be useful when we confront Möbius Inversion. 
<br />
<br />
<b> Lemma </b>
<br />
<br />
Let \(f(n)\) be a multiplicative function, and define a function 
<br /></p>

\[F(n) = \sum_{d|n}f(d).\]

<p><br />
Then \(F(n)\) is also a multiplicative function.
<br />
<br />
<i> Proof. </i> Let there exist \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(\text{gcd}(m,n)=1\). Also, introduce two numbers \(r\) and \(s\). Then we can evaluate
<br /></p>

\[\begin{align*}
F(mn) &amp;
= \sum_{d|mn}f(d) \\ &amp; 
= \sum_{r|m, s|m}f(rs) \\ &amp;
= \sum_{r|m, s|m}f(r)f(s) \\ &amp;
= \sum_{r|m}f(r)\sum_{s|m}f(s) \\ &amp;
= F(m)F(n),
\end{align*}\]

<p><br />
which is the definition of multiplicativity for \(F\). This third row follows because the fact that \(r|m\) and \(s|n\) implies that \(\text{gcd}(r,s)=1\). This is not difficult to show.

Research has always been the medium of progress and innovation in human civilization. From the most primitive forms of discovery, to the most complex and groundbreaking forms of advancement, research has always taken multiple forms, be it in a playful and casual sense: twiddling one’s thumbs and airily thinking, or in a deliberate and serious sense: reading books, websites, and computing without distraction. Regardless, all of these forms of thinking and “work” are research. Yet, it seems that research, in the current world, has taken a familiar yet unprecedented turn; whereas before the leap to providing education we had been closed-minded and unaccepting of new progress from people of diverse backgrounds, we know take a similar leap in the alternate direction: becoming closed-minded to the meaning of research, and the meaning of making progress in different fields in such a fast-moving and elitist field of study. 
<br />
<br />
Today we will be talking largely about mathematics research, especially high school mathematics research. When I first began learning advanced mathematics beyond the conventional elementary work, I did not really consider the idea of research, and was not equipped with the tools necessary to even confront the concept of “making progress”. In the field of mathematics, “progress” is defined very differently from other fields. Rather than simply writing a paper or publishing a book on some lesser-studied topic, the complexity and crudeness of mathematics research converges on one thing: deriving some fundamentally unique and original idea, and from that idea, constructing a web of ideas to work back toward our current arsenal of mathematical ideas. Though this seems easy in word-form, it is far from that. With the enormous breadth of knowledge already dominating the current realm of mathematics, it’s almost impossible to even touch the surface of all current fields and understand everything in utmost detail. Conceptually, yes, but technically, not at all. The amount of time investment required to even begin conducting significant research in any field is enormous; to even begin is a culmination of over 10 years of decent schooling, from high school to undergraduate to graduate and then to pursuing a PhD. This truly illustrates how much human knowledge has truly progressed, and how amazing it is that several thousand of the brightest minds are able to pursue something so representative and so pure of the homo sapien sapien species. 
<br />
<br />
Yet, as competition becomes increasingly fierce, with some of the most competitive schools such as the India Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University (清华), Oxford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or countless more becoming even more and more elite, the idea of conducting any form of research prior to university has become more a matter of “proving oneself to college admissions”, or to demonstrate some degree of interest in a field, and has placed itself on a pedestal representing the “ultimate objective” of a highschool student to appear dedicated to universities. This is nonsense. Before we continue, let us define two different types of highschool research. The first variety of research is transparent; this type of research consists of work that is either interdisciplinary or focuses largely on applications or experiments. This area of research tends to be somewhat easier, and unique and original problems are not difficult to come by. We will call this Type I research. The second variety of research is research that is incredibly gruelling, and relies more on theory and rigour than practice; this type of research consists of rigorous work on theory as opposed to applications, and problems in this area are extremely difficult to come by. We will call this Type II research. The majority of highschool students who have the opportunity to conduct research choose - or perhaps are required to - to conduct Type I research. Many papers on lab experiments, biological analyses, and some form of chemical description are published each year. Type II research, alternatively, only produces a mere few papers. Why may this be? When I first faced Type II research, many things were new to me. I was entranced by the idea of publishing something significant in a journal, and was looking forward to achieving something spectacular. I had been told repeatedly and had seen on social media how people had conducted research in many different disciplines, and it seemed to me that research, especially original research, was a requirement for being accepted to a good university, and was something to “check off” on the long list of objectives in applying to university and living an optimal pre-college life. This mindset is what produces poor quality and ugly research. While I observed many of these research projects, I noticed something in common: they were all Type I research. Rarely, if at all, did I see Type II research: perhaps something in rigorous mathematics, or perhaps something in physics that did not involve some crude application? Not at all. This surprised me a great deal. While I was certain that these projects were great research projects, something bothered me, and I couldn’t pinpoint it exactly.
<br />
<br />
When prestigious universities review applications from highschool students, they search for well-rounded, well-composed, and curious students. The last criteria, “curious”, is where research falls. This implies that regardless of whether a student conducts Type I or Type II research, universities will almost always place these students in the same categories. This does not consider the difference in time and effort spent between a student conducting Type I and Type II research. The culture surrounding Type II research differs drastically from that of Type I research. In a way, Type I research is far more accessible to a general audience in that it is both visualisable and relatable. One instance of how Type I research and Type II research differ in modern culture is through cinema: Type I research is depicted as a remarkable thing with many moving parts and science-fiction-esque concepts, whereas Type II research is a jumble of unrelated ideas - and even if the film is good, it often misses the real rigour. There are two reasons for this: the audience does not care about rigour, and the director or screenwriter does not know what to portray; these people know that what they are depicting is exceptional, yet they do not have the necessary tools to convey its significance. When we speak about universities, appeal falls more on relatable and understandable things than on rigorous work. There is not much I can say about this except that it is a failure of scientific - specifically mathematical - communication. The reason that many beautiful ideas in mathematics and similarly disregarded fields are not well-understood is because they are viewed as foreign, and especially in America, there is a long-standing culture of avoiding foreign things. This is very unfortunate, as with even just a little bit of inspiration, mathematics and its beauty are always waiting with welcoming faces. 
<br />
<br />
What does making research progress mean? Type I research does more to expand current knowledge horizontally, as opposed to Type II research which extends itself vertically. New ideas in Type I research are frequent, so often there is a long list of papers and books that is released, with ultimately identical objectives depending on the trend of a certain time period. The nature of Type I research is to travel stagnant with occasional climaxes, where a revolutionary new idea is introduced every once in a while. What follows is a boom of new ideas and diverging papers, but not long after everything turns gray and bleak as people wait for the next climax. In Type I research fields such as biology and chemistry, the main restriction of progress is technology. Our abilities are as good as our own barriers. Type II research approaches things differently. In Mathematics, there are always diverging ideas, and while revolutionary ideas are truly monumental, the realm of possibility is even more endless than one can imagine, and people strive nonstop, nearly incessantly. It’s almost as though I discover a new idea or entirely new field of study every day. Mathematics has no bound on progress. The only thing preventing progress in mathematics is our mental capacity, not the technology that we rely on. I am no humanist, but the fact that I study mathematics is the most human thing that I do. While technology will eventually - and already does - offer the most advanced forms of computation and artificial intelligence, the field of mathematics is what will never become obsolete, because it is simply that impossible to replicate. Type II research is just that: investigating a problem that seems so unreal and so disconnected from reality, pursuing something so inherently human and anthropogenic. 
<br />
<br />
And even with all of this said, Type II research remains a mystery to many, especially to college admissions. While scientific communication of Type I research is crucial to nurturing a developing society, the push for Type II research to be placed in the forefront of modern human progress is not only important, but necessary. Now that I look back, I realise what had disturbed me the most about Type I research projects: the melancholy of the fact that the only thing that can resurface in modern society is something that can be generally understood, and not something that can be appreciated to its fullest.

Maybe this is just a naïve interpretation of something that I don’t fully comprehend, but these are some of my thoughts.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An essay that is probably not an essay]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An introduction to this website</title><link href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/firstpost/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An introduction to this website" /><published>2023-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/firstpost</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/firstpost/"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post on this website. I have created this website to display my work as an amateur mathematician. (It has been largely inspired by a similar website created by my friend Kyle; you can find his website <a href="https://12buntu.github.io/Book-N/">here</a>) Even though I am only a high school student, there are many more opportunities for me to explore my interests in mathematics, and many more opportunities for me to collaborate with friends and professors - or work independently - to produce valuable research.
<br />
<br />
While this space is largely for displaying my formal work, nothing is stopping me from using it to document any of my research journeys, academic interests, or even casual discoveries and playful expositions. All of my work here is done with and sometimes without purpose. The only limitation for whatever interests me is prerequisites, but even that can eventually be transgressed. I guess that means that what I do here is like a cloud… dreamy… drifting, and oh so unpredictable. 
<br />
<br />
Slightly forced metaphors aside, the reason that I have been able to do much of the work displayed here is attributed to a multitude of significant people who have guided me through my expositions and self-discovery. While I cannot name each individual, it is important to acknowledge the origin of this lifelong interest in mathematics. Something so valuable takes an immense amount of passion and belief to awaken, so I would like to thank 王老师 for being the ticket to my future endeavours; the first ray of sun on such a blazing horizon by the sea…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some words and some nonwords]]></summary></entry></feed>
