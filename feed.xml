While I did submit to the arXiv, the arXiv is not a peer-reviewed journal, unlike many other mathematical journals. Over the past two months I have been working carefully on a paper that relates closely to the topic in <i> On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity </i>, and I was debating whether to submit it to the American Mathematical Monthly (AMM) - a prestigious journal for expository articles that is well-respected in the math community - or another journal such as the Mathematics Magazine (MM). After much thought and revision (as well as some much-needed guidance), I decided that my article was not novel enough to warrant a place in AMM, but that it would perhaps be suitable for MM. So, today (or rather yesterday), I submitted my article to MM. 
<br />
<br />
Here are some thoughts that I have. First, I do not have incredibly high expectations for the publication of this article. While I know that MM is perhaps on the lower end of journals in general (despite featuring incredibly expository work), it still has a lower standard based in originality and novelty. While I think my paper certainly is interesting and would be appropriate to the readership of MM, I am not entirely sure. I guess we’ll see. Second, publication takes a long time. The website for MM indicates that, on average, the first decision regarding an article will be 19 days. Now, this is kind of arbitrary - it can take far longer or far less time. Looking back at previously published articles, it seems that people took anywhere from a few weeks to an entire year to publish. That’s a long time. I guess we’ll see how long this takes!
<br />
<br />
If the paper is rejected from MM, I can still possibly publish in a different undergraduate journal - we’ll see. Either way, I’m going to post this paper on the arXiv at some point. I will update this page if anything happens. 
<br />
<br />
(2 October, 2024)
<br />
<br />
The paper is now informally available on this website. I am still awaiting notice from MM. A pdf is available <a href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/assets/pdf/matias-quadcub3.pdf">here</a>, and the arXiv preprint is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21646">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
(11 October, 2024)
<br />
<br />
This journey has reached an important milestone. It seems that my paper has been “reviewed favorably” by Mathematics Magazine, and after completing minor revisions, it will go on to publication. In this post, I’ll cover a little bit of the timeline of the journey this paper has taken and some of my thoughts.</p>

<p><img src="/quadcryo/assets/img/R_and_R.png" alt="Timeline picture" style="height:100%;width:100%" class="center" /></p>

<p>The above shows a sort of timeline of events in the submission process (I’ll update it later when more stuff happens, but for now, I have until 18 April, 2025 to revise and resubmit for eventual publication). 
<br />
<br />
Here are some initial thoughts. The publication process seems like something really exciting, but in reality, it’s mostly waiting. Just waiting. And a lot of it. This should be pretty clear from the timeline shown as evidenced by the 4 month gap between submission and decision, but it really isn’t put into perspective until you’re in it. I found myself refreshing that page for a while until I eventually gave up - each step in the process felt like an eternal wait, so reaching a point with some more certainty is a great feeling. If I have any more thoughts or any interesting comments about referee comments on my paper, maybe I’ll write more here. For now, it’s just some revisions.

This isn’t the subject of this post though. Over this J-Term, I had the privilege of learning about hyperreal numbers, which extends \(\mathbb{R}\) to the hyperreal numbers by including infinitesimal and infinite numbers. I gave a presentation on this topic that follows the first couple sections of Keisler’s very rigorous (maybe unnecessarily so) treatment of something that seems no more than a recreational creation of Conway, despite its vast history in the development of nonstandard analysis. I didn’t have the opportunity to learn much more, but from what I can see, Keisler’s treatment focuses a lot on words, sentences, and other “grammatical” concepts from model theory that I have yet to learn about. Maybe I’ll take a look at some point in the future.

Even though <i> On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity </i> is on the arXiv, I would like to also submit a portion to a journal as mentioned before (the choices are between the College Mathematics Journal and the Mathematics Magazine - I have to choose between them as their targetted audiences are slightly different). I have mentioned this before, but I will likely cover some results leading up to cubic reciprocity in a more expository style: I’m using playful prose in combination with rigorous language to place the law of cubic reciprocity in an entertaining light. 
<br />
<br />
For a long time now I have been interested in Artin reciprocity. Artin reciprocity is the final generalization of reciprocity laws, and understanding even its statement requires substantial knowledge of class field theory, genus theory, algebraic number theory, and more. Cubic reciprocity is a good first step, but so much more is needed to approach Artin reciprocity. I believe a long term mathematics goal would be to read up on more algebra (preferably Dummit and Foote), a lot more algebraic number theory, and finally class field theory. This is usually something taught in an upper-level graduate course, so I don’t expect to study much now. 
<br />
<br />
In the next academic year I will be working on a project concerning knot theory. I’m not exactly sure in which direction this project will go, but I have some particular interest in mosaic knots, and I have a few resources and ideas for open problems to approach. We’ll see where that goes. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, university applications are fast approaching, and I have yet to start. Might as well start soon.

I hear very similar arguments in either situation: if someone believes that mathematics is a language, it is because they believe that it is capable of expressing ideas and facts, it contains symbols that can be read (whether from one language or multiple), and it is able to describe many things; if someone believes that mathematics is not a language, it is because they believe it is incapable of expressing emotion, complex thoughts, and does not possess qualities of art or creativity. Both reasons deserve more questioning. 
<br />
<br />
While both hold some ideas that are true to an extent, I believe that the inability to classify whether mathematics is a language is down to the fact that people do not know enough mathematics: the reasons for either argument are misinformed. I believe that mathematics is distinct from language in the sense that it describes something that is universally true, whether applied in the sense of physical descriptions of phenomena, or pure in the sense that abstraction is the only possible expression of ideas. Language typically develops from a certain form of culture: culture can be defined very loosely, where two friends can have a culture between them and a group of people might find a cultural affinity in collecting watches. In either case, there is almost always a cultural syntax that is commonly understood between members of the culture, but if this language is exposed to members of a different culture, many details might be lost in translation. This occurs on a multitude of levels, because likely a watch-enthusiast would be able to communicate with non-watch-enthusiasts if they are descriptive enough; a culture between two friends might be difficult to explain to members of other cultures, as often the relationship between two individuals is so rooted in experience and familiarity that to understand it would be to <i> be </i> one of the said friends. 
<br />
<br />
Mathematics, however, is different. Yes, while mathematics does have a culture in the sense that educational institutions often contort the meaning of who <i> does </i> mathematics - whether it is white men at Oxford University in the 19th century who twiddle their thumbs and “think about equations”, or young people pushing new ideas and theories that no one has heard of or is willing to hear about - the ambiguity of mathematical culture is so confusing that it is impossible to differentiate “this mathematics” from “that mathematics”. Under every single misconception and opinion regarding mathematics in any environment is a truth: every single well-established fact is true no matter what cultural syntax is used to express it. Some people believe pure mathematics is unimportant, but even if that may be true, it exists beyond the purpose of objective mathematical syntax: it just doesn’t matter. 
<br />
<br />
I believe the first point at which you can truly consider what mathematics is is when you encounter proof. Many a mathematician will know how variable the way in which a result can be proven truly is, and I can say that I have written proofs in many different ways. Considerations of “elegance” and “non-elegance” are subjective, but they absolutely play a crucial role in determining whether something is beautiful or not. There are even many types of syntax with which a proof can be described, whether it is strictly using logic or using analogy. In either case, whether a proof uses a particular system of logic or field-related syntax, what it fundamentally describes is true no matter what. 
<br />
<br />
This brings me to the following. Does it even mean anything to question whether mathematics is a language? Mathematics is so different from any human or non-human language because it simply does not possess a universal cultural syntax. Rather, it is an amalgamation of the vocabulary from every single possible culture and it exists beyond self and other. Whether it is a language has no meaning: the people or things who - or that - do mathematics have their own interpretation of what mathematics is and how it can be expressed. Humanity is not developed enough to understand how different mathematics looks in different cultural syntaxes, but a good example that would seem distant for many anyway would be something like the difference between two different fields: say category theory and number theory. While these certainly have many connections (I will not describe them because I am not familiar enough of either field), on the surface level, one would never think that number theory - something that can be described fairly easily (it’s definitely not easy, but the “big picture” ideas are more easily accessible) - is related to the often archaic seeming diagrams and ideas of category theory. Yet it is eye-opening to realize how much number theory really does fit in the framework of category theory: structures in number theory have vivid relationships with other structures in category theory. 
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I believe that mathematics deserves to be separate from language; by analogy, history is often attributed to the humanities, but more often than not it behaves more like a social science, where arguments are shaped and deduced rather than discovered. Mathematics is just that in a different way: a study that is neither a language nor a science, but something else entirely.

Addition and multiplication appear so frequently and so fundamentally that you just can’t avoid them. They chase you around in circles, and much of mathematics is like that. Like addition and multiplication, some topics in mathematics are so fundamental that at any stage of progression or expertise, you will encounter the same things over and over again. It’s well known that repetition can further ingrain certain concepts in your head, but sometimes doing it too much can cause you to implode: if you’ve seen something so many times and understand a concept so well, at what point will seeing it one more time cause you to forget everything I know?</p>

<p>I don’t know the answer to that question. It was meant to be rhetorical, because maybe it doesn’t have an answer at all, or it is specific to each individual mathematician. This leads me to a conversation about the American education system: it doesn’t work. An education system must equally combine cognitive capability with general aptitude with certain precision to produce the best students and inspire self-growth and independent thinking. China has a wonderful education system, in that children are burnt out by middle school and commit suicide with the same frequency with which the earth orbits the sun. America has a wonderful education system, in that it treats everyone equally with very little consideration for differences in capability, instead insisting that everyone is “very good”, neglecting those who suffer and those who excel. Not to mention the frequent school shootings, but that’s a discussion for another time. Both are examples of extremes.</p>

<p>China has it’s own educational problems, but ultimately it produces intelligent, capable, individuals who will without doubt go on to achieve great things. America, perhaps not so much. Especially in regard to mathematics education, educators often reiterate to their most advanced students how great they are. While it can be a good motivator, sometimes a student can be most benefitted when told the truth. The truth is that not everyone is brilliant, and conversely, not everyone is stupid. I believe that every mathematics student should always be humbled by what they encounter. I say this from experience, as I find that I learn the most about both myself and my potential when I am made aware of my lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>While trivialities and repetition are necessary, it is through struggling and not being told how “great” you are that you really push yourself. You should always strive to be better. However, you should also know your own bounds. An example is the field of topology. The value of topology is in its rigour, but to truly digest that rigour, you mustn’t go about it like reading a children’s book and looking at pictures like topology is some mystical field. I admit that right now, I don’t have the background to learn topology. I don’t deserve to learn topology because I would only do the field and myself a disservice: I know nothing of what topology really should be, and to treat it exactly like a picture book would make me hate the subject. Regardless of what anyone says, this is a fact. You must know what you can and cannot do.</p>

<p>So, to change my tone to one of more optimism, maybe some repetition can be beneficial. I have always found helping others with mathematics to be a wonderful opportunity to test your own depth of knowledge, so perhaps when you are familiar with something you can be of assistance to others. Maybe there is truly a teacher in me after all.</p>

<p>It is difficult to quantify what mathematical growth truly means. Personally, mathematical growth is dictated by my ability to read proofs, to understand difficult concepts, and to approach a field with enough confidence and experience to be leisurely curious. In other words, mathematical maturity. However, “growth” suggests that I’m gaining something, that I’m not only applying what I’m knowing but being surprised by little things and large things that I’ve never encountered before that develop my mathematical maturity. While learning old mathematics may solidify my mathematical maturity, it rarely gives me new insights into something I already know (unless it is something I know little about). Perhaps I should find positive in relearning old mathematics and seek out things that I never would have considered? Perhaps I should enter new dialogues on adjacent topics to gain enrichment in another form? I don’t really know. We’ll see.

Hello! It has been a while since I have last posted, but here I am now! A few months ago (January or so) I started working on a paper related to the study of Galois fields (finite fields) and higher reciprocity. Since then I have written nearly 45 pages, and it is quite nearly complete. Over these few months, I have furthered my mathematical maturity, taken advice and learned a lot from both peers and professors, and experienced a few revelations here and there in relation to some topics or proofs. I also created a poster and gave a sort of informal presentation on the paper! Writing is hard, and when you’re busy it’s difficult to make significant progress. I think I initially said that I would complete this by the end of January; then the end of March; then May; and now look, it’s already June. I wouldn’t say this is procrastination at all - rather a combination of business and a quest for greater mathematical maturity. 
<br />
<br />
Even while this paper is not fully complete, I will provide the abstract for any who are interested in reading about what is covered in the paper. 
<br />
<br />
<i> Abstract </i><br />
<br />
Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as ``the forgotten reciprocity laws”, largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. However, this paper aims to approach reciprocity with ample detail to motivate its existence. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group \(\mathbb{F}^{*}\). While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted \(\mathbb{Z}[\omega]\), and further investigations into the residue class ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]\) for \(\pi\) prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies.</p>

<p>We will then use multiplicative characters to define the cubic residue character and state cubic reciprocity in its entirety. Following this, we provide a proof of the cubic reciprocity law as well as its supplementary theorems using cubic Gauss sums. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime \(2\) and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for \(2\) to be a cubic residue.</p>

<p>We conclude with the statement of biquadratic reciprocity and provide a brief discussion on how it relates to cubic reciprocity in both its proof and usage of the analogy between the Eisenstein integers, \(\mathbb{Z}[\omega]\), and the Gaussian integers, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\). 
<br />
<br />
When the completed paper appears, I will reference it here. I will likely put it on the arXiv. (it is now there at the top of this page)
<br />
<br />
UPDATE (25 June, 2024): I have decided that I will submit a section of this paper to either the <i> Mathematics Magazine </i> or the <i> College Mathematics Journal </i>. To prepare for submission I will need to edit one particular section to be in a more expository form with plenty of examples, and I might even need to shorten it since it is currently 15 pages, and the alleged limit for either magazine is approximately 14 pages.

At the end of this short exploration, I looked into the world of omnific integers, which generalise the concept of integers to the surreal numbers. For instance, while the integers may contain numbers such as 5, 10, or 1000, the omnific integers include numbers such as \(\omega\), which is the supposed smallest infinite number. Omnific integers allow you to do arithmetic with infinitely large numbers, and for this reason it can be extended to consider many problems in number theory as well. One aspect that I investigated very shallowly was Pell’s equation and how its solution may differ if all integers are instead omnific. 
<br />
<br />
During this short exploration, I made use of Knuth’s <i> Surreal Numbers </i>, which is a sort of novelette that explores the construction and discovery of surreal numbers through the lens of two individuals on a desolate island. It’s perhaps not the most rigorous “math text”, but it certainly has value and can be read like a storybook. I also looked into Conway’s (RIP) <i> On Numbers and Games </i>, which studies surreal numbers in its numerous aspects, from algebra to analysis to number theory, and eventually to the reason for its initial creation: games. It certainly is a rigorous text, but it is very self-contained, and if I had more time I would have been able to explore its nuances in much more detail than I have. At the end of my exploration, I gave a very brief presentation on omnific integers, and here are the <a href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/projectpdf/omnific_slides.pdf">slides</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fun exploration into game theory and a new number system]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cubic and Biquadratic reciprocity</title><link href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/cubicbiquadratic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cubic and Biquadratic reciprocity" /><published>2023-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/cubicbiquadratic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/cubicbiquadratic/"><![CDATA[<p>New project time whilst I’m on winter break! This time I’m investigating cubic and biquadratic reciprocity, and already, as I’m about 2 weeks in, there’s so much modern algebra and stuff about finite fields that I have to either relearn or refresh my memory on. So far the most important part is understanding finite fields, both in terms of construction and existence. I’m nearly done learning about the basics of finite fields, so I then have to move on to understanding multiplicative characters (I have worked with quadratic multiplicative characters in my quadratic reciprocity project, but higher reciprocity demands cubic, biquadratic, \(n\)th degree multiplicative characters), as well as the stuff that comes with it such as Gauss sums. Then I can finally approach cubic and biquadratic reciprocity. 
<br />
<br />
Maybe I’ll write a short expository paper about the journey to cubic and biquadratic reciprocity; we’ll see if I have time (If I do, I estimate that it will be perhaps 15-25 pages? I’m not quite sure yet, but it will be one of my larger projects, as it also hinges upon parts of my quadratic reciprocity project). This is kind of my last expository venture as from now on pretty much everything is going to be different, and original research will finally (kind of) be in my grasp!
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will update this page when I either produce or don’t produce something. I am keeping detailed notes with insights and proofs from other areas (cough cough mostly algebra), so if I don’t end up writing an expository paper I suppose I can just provide those.

Giving up is just not an option when you have come so far, and really that is reflected in the pain that is felt when one endures so much self-driven disrespect and harshness. It’s hard to come to terms with one’s own belief of excellence, and everyone suffers from this fact. This leads me to a point. I am not brilliant at mathematics. In a world of so many people, it is impossible for someone to not know more proofs than me, not be better at formulating ideas, not be better at writing formally, not solve problems more efficiently, and so on. The list is practically infinite. 
<br />
<br />
I think that being aware of this fact is a good thing. Self-pity is often the downfall of many people, so I choose not to fall down that rabbit-hole. Maybe it doesn’t matter; maybe the point of doing mathematics is not to be the best, but to be the bravest: everyone is capable of being brave, right? Everyone is capable of being brave. Everyone, is capable of being brave. And even then, maybe it’s not about being the something-est in any realm? Maybe just go with the flow, as they say, or be human and take the praise and ridicule, then forget about it tomorrow. Maybe it’s just the small things. Look at the big picture, they say; but don’t go fighting windmills when the time isn’t right: that will just make you fight more windmills. The small things accumulate and then eventually you’ll be able to fight an army of windmills, just maybe they’re smaller. Maybe you could conquer France too (or offshore wind farms). The point is, maybe you just have to step back and think about everything for a moment. Do everything slowly, like a sloth. Eventually you will - I will - understand. It just takes some time. Sometimes that time is a lifetime, and we have to take solemn comfort in that. Imagine if you lived for eternity. Bleh.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journeys" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not brilliant at mathematics.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Journeys II</title><link href="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/journeys2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Journeys II" /><published>2023-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/journeys2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://quadcryo.github.io/quadcryo/blog/2023/journeys2/"><![CDATA[<p>The first variant of this rather fragile topic touched upon several existential topics, so in this post we will explore several topics that are more conventional, and are perhaps slightly easier to talk about. This of course, being, first, the idea of mathematical maturity. 
<br />
<br />
Now, there are hundreds of accounts defining the meaning of mathematical maturity, and I highly recommend simply searching for them: the answers you will find there are more meaningful than whatever I can produce here, as I myself am still in the early stages of achieving mathematical maturity. In fact, I would argue that “achieving mathematical maturity” as a goal is not truly possible. While there may be a threshold for which one’s mind becomes slightly less competent (studies have shown that there likely is no correlation between an increase in age and scientific productivity/ingenuity: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778031">Age and Scientific Performance, Stephen Cole 1979</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778031">Age and Achievement in Mathematics: A Case-Study in the Sociology of Science, Nancy Stern 1978</a>), an academic (should) never stop evolving and learning, meaning that the state of maturity is a constantly shifting constant. Mathematics in particular, as a field that is really just entirely unpredictable, demands constant flexibility from the doers of, and there’s just no time to grow old if one hopes to experience it to its fullest. So now, to speak of mathematical maturity on an elementary level, it is fair to say that this can really only first be considered upon entering university for the vast majority of future mathematicians. There are a considerable few who have already known of both their abilities and interest prior to this milestone: for instance, I had the pleasure of attending a summer class at the <a href="https://eulercircle.com/">Euler Circle</a>; this program teaches students a variety of advanced undergraduate and even some graduate topics in mathematics. Even though I produced something of decent value nat the end of this summer experience, the mathematical maturity of my peers far exceeded my own, and it was clear that they were just on a different level. I was just inspired by the competence and passion those people had for mathematics. Several of the participants in the Euler Circle had also participated in and (I believe) one had won the Regeneron Science Talent Search a few years prior. This is nothing short of extraordinary, especially when you consider how rare pure mathematics is in the general scientific community. When I think of mathematical maturity, I think about these people. It’s the ability and confidence to pick up a textbook and understand its contents without much consideration for prerequisites. I believe that mathematical maturity is the ability for one to confront new mathematical knowledge with an open and qualified mind. As I said earlier, this is impossible to achieve, as built into its very definition is the notion of “new mathematical knowledge”: nothing is really learnable in the first attempt, and there’s always bound to be something so creative and unique that even the weird geniuses will struggle to understand it. I mean isn’t that how new areas were invented - weird geniuses who stumbled upon something extraordinary?

Now let’s talk about taking a break. Is it okay to take a break? As with most things, taking a break allows us to stand back and look at the bigger picture and appreciate life when it becomes too chaotic. Yet, I am at a point where it feels unproductive to not constantly be thinking about mathematics. Many have told me that taking a break is not a good idea, as it reduced my capacity to learn more, but I somewhat disagree. While a break takes away valuable time to learn mathematics, it is also an opportunity to expand my range of view. While the most dedicated (complete respect to them) are hammering away at hard problems regularly, I can sit back and expand the bigger picture, allowing myself to 1) not experience burnout too soon and 2) think about what areas need improvement and most importantly 3) think about what I want to learn and what I need to do to learn it. Burnout is a severe issue in teenagers and even in academics: how dreadful would it be to fall out of love with the area you love most? Taking a break is a good way to step back and do other things: then you can return refreshed and ready to explore new areas or do new work. As for improvement, while this is still considered “thinking about math”, I find it almost therapeutic to envision what areas you are weakest in, and determine exactly what must be done to achieve your objectives. More often than not your limitations are just your weakpoints, and you can confront them directly after your break. Finally, in concert with the second point, learning new stuff is just spectacular, especially when it’s a new area that you hadn’t explored much (combinatorics for me <i> cough cough </i>). But, diving straight in is what causes burnout, so I’m stepping back to repeat the second point and wait until I have more opportuntities to really do significant work. This allows me to maintain a healthy relationship with mathematics and my learning.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="journeys" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What should define mathematical maturity and when it is viable to take a break?]]></summary></entry></feed>
